## Introduction
This case is based on the University Timetabling Problem, which is inspired by the University of Amsterdam Computer Science track. In this project the timetabling problem contains 29 courses, 609 students and 7 locations. In order to solve this case, several algorithms are used to create the optimal timetable. Algorithms such as: greedy, random-greedy, beam search, hillclimber and simulated annealing.
